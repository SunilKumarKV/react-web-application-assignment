## Features

- **User Authentication (Mock)**: The login page allows users to "sign in" using a mock Google login button.
- **Dashboard Page**: Displays the user's profile information (name, email, phone) and a chart showing user profile data.
- **User Data Form**: Allows users to input and update their personal data such as name, email, phone, and address. The form automatically saves the data to `localStorage`.
- **Rich Text Editor**: A rich text editor (using the React Quill library) allows users to write and save content locally with auto-saving.
- **Charts**: Displays various charts using Recharts, based on data stored in the application state.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can toggle between dark and light modes across the application.

## Technologies Used

- React (Functional Components and Hooks)
- React Router
- Recharts (for charts)
- React Quill (for rich text editor)
- LocalStorage for persistent data
- CSS for styling and dark/light mode toggling
